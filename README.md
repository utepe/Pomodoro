# Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 5 short breaks.

This app displays a timer. When started, the timmer runs for 25 mins, then starts a short break of 5 mins. After four of these Pomodoro intervals, a long break of 25 mins is rewarded. If using Windows, notifications are displayed, and a beep sound is played after the timer reaches zero, alerting you that a session is completed, or that your break is over. All time lengths are configurable by clicking the options menu, if a time legnth is configured, the reset button must be pressed.

### Install:
